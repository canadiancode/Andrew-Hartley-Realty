> HTML:
- Added the cs stylesheet reference to /css/style.css
- added the basic template for the header

> SCSS:
- Downloaded the Live SASS Compiler into VS Code
- Need to click the "Watch SCSS" at the bottom of the VS Code window (ner the Live Server area) to get the SCSS to compile 
-  Now, al edits within the style.scss will get auto-populated to the css file before getting loaded on the browser 
- started on the css for the header (barely)
